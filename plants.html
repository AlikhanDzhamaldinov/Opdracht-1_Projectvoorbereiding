  <h1>Monstera Varieties</h1>
  <p>
    Monstera plants are beloved for their dramatic foliage, natural leaf fenestrations,
    and tropical aesthetic. Native to Central and South America, Monsteras are climbing
    aroids that thrive in bright indirect light and high humidity. Below are some of
    the most popular and fascinating species grown by collectors and houseplant enthusiasts.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera deliciosa</h2>
  <p>
    The most iconic Monstera, famous for its large split leaves. As the plant matures,
    it develops deep fenestrations and can grow enormous foliage. It is relatively easy
    to care for and widely available.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera deliciosa 'Albo Variegata'</h2>
  <p>
    A highly sought-after variegated form with striking white sectors. Each leaf is unique.
    Because variegation reduces chlorophyll, this variety grows slower and requires brighter light.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera deliciosa 'Thai Constellation'</h2>
  <p>
    Known for its creamy, speckled variegation resembling stars. Unlike Albo, the variegation
    is genetically stable. It is prized for its consistent pattern and luxurious appearance.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera adansonii</h2>
  <p>
    Often called the “Swiss Cheese Plant,” this species features smaller leaves with oval holes.
    It grows quickly and is excellent for hanging baskets or climbing supports.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera adansonii 'Variegata'</h2>
  <p>
    A rarer variegated version of adansonii. Leaves display splashes of white or yellow,
    making it popular among collectors.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera dubia</h2>
  <p>
    A unique shingling species that climbs flat surfaces. Juvenile leaves lie against the support
    and have beautiful silver patterns. Mature leaves look completely different.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera obliqua</h2>
  <p>
    Extremely rare and famous for its paper-thin leaves with massive perforations.
    Frequently confused with adansonii, true obliqua is a collector’s treasure.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera siltepecana</h2>
  <p>
    Features elongated leaves with silvery sheen during juvenile stages. As it matures,
    fenestrations may develop. Excellent for climbing displays.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera pinnatipartita</h2>
  <p>
    Juvenile leaves are simple, but mature leaves become deeply split and dramatic.
    This transformation makes it fascinating to grow.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera standleyana</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike many Monsteras, this species has solid leaves without holes. Variegated forms
    are particularly popular for their speckled patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera peru (Karstenianum)</h2>
  <p>
    Recognized by its thick, textured, almost blistered leaves. It lacks fenestrations
    but offers a very unusual appearance.
  </p>

  <h2>Monstera subpinnata</h2>
  <p>
    Known for delicate, feather-like mature leaves. It differs significantly from the
    classic Monstera look and is loved by collectors.
